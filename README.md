A general workflow for analyzing Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) data starting from FASTQ files:

1. **Raw Data Quality Control**: Assess the quality of the raw FASTQ files using tools such as FastQC.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: This involves adapter removal, low-quality read filtering, and sequence trimming. Tools like Cutadapt and Trimmomatic can be used for this purpose.

3. **Sequence Alignment**: Align the preprocessed reads to a reference genome. Tools like BWA or Bowtie2 are commonly used.

4. **Post-alignment Processing**: This includes marking duplicates, local realignment around indels, and base quality score recalibration. The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) is often used for these steps.

5. **Target Enrichment**: This step involves the use of biotinylated oligonucleotide probes to selectively capture the exonic regions (the regions of the genome that encode proteins) from the genome.

6. **Variant Calling**: Identify variants (SNPs, indels) in each sample. GATK's HaplotypeCaller or tools like FreeBayes can be used.

7. **Variant Annotation and Filtering**: Annotate the variants with information about their function and filter out benign and common variants. Tools like ANNOVAR, SnpEff, or VEP (Variant Effect Predictor) can be used for annotation.
